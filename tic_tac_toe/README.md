## Introduction
Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game where players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game. This version of the game is built using Python's tkinter library for the graphical user interface.

## How to Play
- Run the `main.py` file to start the game.
- Players take turns clicking on the squares to place their "X" or "O".
- The game automatically detects when there is a winner (3 in a row) or a tie.
- You can reset the game at any time using the "Options" menu.

## Features
